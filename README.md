An open board for anyone to post content of events happening in a city where they live. Everyone needs to be aware of a situation where a change is needed or it may affect their
course of action in aspects of health, welfare, infrastructure, transport and a lot of others in daily life.
There is inefficiency in spreading awareness about the events in the city. People are only connected to their close circles through social media. Taking small steps to begin with,
the Universities are models which resemble a city in various aspects. It lacks a common platform for spreading awareness about the various ongoing activities. Up to date information about the events occurred in the campus is not known to everyone and also not in time sometime. Whether it is any academic issue, cleanliness related query or any other issue.
